# Expert Guide: Deploy Streamlit to Azure

This expert guide outlines the process for deploying a Streamlit application to Azure, focusing on Docker utilization for seamless deployment across different environments, including AWS and Azure.

## Quick Start

Deploying your Streamlit app to Azure involves containerization with Docker, ensuring your application is environment-agnostic and scalable. This guide assumes you have a working Streamlit app and basic familiarity with Docker and Azure services.

### Prerequisites

- Streamlit application ready for deployment
- Docker and Azure CLI installed on your development machine
- Visual Studio Code with Azure and Docker extensions
- An active Azure subscription

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Dockerization

Create a `Dockerfile` in your project root. This file instructs Docker on how to build an image of your app, specifying the base Python image, required ports, and dependencies.

#### Dockerfile Example

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim
EXPOSE 8501
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt ./requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "your_app.py"]

**### Step 2: Resolve Port Mapping for Azure**

Ensure your docker-compose.yml includes the correct port mapping for Azure. Azure prefers port 80 for HTTP traffic but your container will listen on Streamlit's default port 8501. Map these correctly to avoid deployment issues.

docker-compose.yml Port Mapping
version: '3'
services:
  streamlit:
    build:
      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
      context: ./
    ports:
      - "8081:8501"
Step 3: Azure Container Registry (ACR)
Before deployment, create an ACR through the Azure portal or CLI. This registry will store your Docker images.

Step 4: Azure App Service Plan
Select an App Service Plan that supports Docker. Avoid the Free tier for production deployments. B1 or higher tiers are recommended for better performance and support for custom domains and SSL.

Step 5: Deployment
Push your Docker image to ACR, then deploy it to Azure App Service using the Azure CLI or through the VS Code Azure extension. Ensure your App Service is linked to your ACR and select the correct Docker image and tag for deployment.

Conclusion
Deploying Streamlit apps to Azure using Docker offers flexibility, scalability, and environment consistency. By following these expert tips, you'll ensure a smooth deployment process and a robust production environment.
